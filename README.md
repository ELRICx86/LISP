# LISP
Asp.net project About Local Internet Service Provider

This is a project made in my 3rd year of university web development course.

In this project I mainly create a web application to manage a ISP.

This Project Include:
                USER Section:
                        1.User Registration.
                        2.User Signup.
                        3.Package View.
                        4.Billpay Section.
                        5.Profile Update with subscribed package list.
                
               Admin Section:
                         1.User Management.
                         2.User Authentication/Approval.
                         3.Package Management (CRUD operations)
                         4.User profile status with subscriptions.
                         5.Flag Users.
                         6.Payment Status.
                      
Future plan:

I want to add a ftp server with my project in future.
Also want to migrate my package in MVC format.
